# MasterThesis: Forecasting Demand Across Products and Stores  

In retail businesses, forecasting demand is crucial for having the right inventory available at the right time at the right place.

## What’s This About?  
This project is all about **predicting demand**—but not just for a single product or store. The challenge is to build and compare multiple time series models across a **huge number of product-store combinations**. Some patterns are easy to predict, others are chaotic. The goal? **Find out what works best, why, and how to improve it.**  

## What I'm Doing  
- Experimenting with **different forecasting models**—from traditional statistical methods to deep learning.  
- Evaluating performance across **thousands of product-store pairs** to identify trends and challenges.  
- Investigating **what makes certain time series easier (or harder) to predict** and how to handle variability.  

## Why This Matters  
Understanding demand fluctuations is **critical for inventory management, logistics, and business strategy**. If we can predict demand accurately, we can optimize stock levels, reduce waste, and make smarter decisions.  


This project is a mix of **data science, machine learning, experimentation, and real-world problem-solving**—because forecasting isn’t just about numbers; it’s about making better decisions.
