# ðŸ“Š Master Thesis: Forecasting Demand Across Products and Stores

## ðŸ§  Overview

In the dynamic world of retail, accurately forecasting demand is pivotal. It ensures that the right products are available at the right time and place, optimizing inventory levels and enhancing customer satisfaction. This project delves into the intricate task of predicting demand across a vast array of product-store combinations, leveraging cutting-edge deep learning models to tackle the inherent complexities of retail demand patterns.

## ðŸš€ Project Objectives

- **Explore and build powerful deep learning models** to generate highly accurate and robust demand forecasts.
- **Investigate** how modern architectures can learn from vast and diverse time series data, revealing what makes forecasting easierâ€”or harderâ€”in the retail context.
- **Implement and evaluate** advanced models across thousands of product-store combinations, identifying patterns, uncovering challenges, and benchmarking performance.
- **Leverage probabilistic forecasting** to capture uncertainty and improve decision-making in real-world retail operations.

This is both a technical deep dive and a practical implementation, focused on delivering real business value through smarter forecasting.

## ðŸ§° Methodology

To address the multifaceted nature of retail demand forecasting, this project employs the **GluonTS** libraryâ€”a robust toolkit for probabilistic time series modeling. GluonTS facilitates the implementation and evaluation of several state-of-the-art models, including:

- **DeepAR**: An autoregressive recurrent network model that captures complex temporal dependencies and provides probabilistic forecasts.
- **Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT)**: A model that combines recurrent layers with attention mechanisms, offering interpretable multi-horizon forecasts.
- **WaveNet**: Originally designed for audio generation, this model's dilated causal convolutions are adept at capturing long-range dependencies in time series data.
- **Simple Feedforward (MLP)**: A baseline model that, despite its simplicity, serves as a valuable benchmark for evaluating more complex architectures.

And many more models available in the GluonTS library.

By utilizing GluonTS, the project benefits from a unified framework that streamlines model development, training, and evaluation, ensuring consistency and efficiency throughout the forecasting pipeline.

## ðŸ›’ Relevance to the Retail Industry

Accurate demand forecasting is a cornerstone of effective retail operations. It informs inventory management, supply chain logistics, and strategic planning. The integration of deep learning models, as facilitated by GluonTS, offers several advantages:

- **Probabilistic Forecasting**: Unlike point estimates, probabilistic forecasts provide a range of possible outcomes, enabling better risk assessment and decision-making.
- **Scalability**: The models can handle large-scale datasets, making them suitable for retailers with extensive product lines and store networks.
- **Adaptability**: The ability to incorporate external factors (e.g., promotions, holidays, weather) enhances the models' responsiveness to real-world influences on demand.

By harnessing these capabilities, the project aims to deliver forecasting solutions that are not only accurate but also practical and actionable for the retail sector.

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Outcomes

- **Enhanced Forecast Accuracy**: Improved predictions leading to optimized inventory levels and reduced stockouts or overstock situations.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlined supply chain processes resulting from better alignment between demand forecasts and inventory planning.
- **Strategic Insights**: Deeper understanding of demand drivers, enabling more informed business decisions and targeted marketing strategies.
